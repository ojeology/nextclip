That is stale.\n\nOn 23 August 2026, Canva’s own Affinity download page prints “$0, free.” The FAQ is blunt: every tool in the Pixel, Vector and Layout studios is included, with free updates, and you do not need Canva Pro to use those studios. You do need a Canva account — free is enough — because Affinity is now a Canva product.\n\nThat is a bigger fact than Plasfy’s $199 lifetime deal. Affinity was already the serious desktop editor people named when they were tired of Photoshop’s subscription. Canva bought it and took the price to zero.",

The same FAQ says there is no release date yet for the new Affinity on iPad, and tells people to keep running V2 on iPad for now. I am not going to invent a tablet app.\n\nYou must be online to download and activate the licence with the Canva account. After that, they say you can work offline, including for extended periods.",
