It is a directory.\n\nPlasfy is interesting for a narrower reason. It positions itself as the thing you buy so you can stop paying Canva every month. Its own homepage says “Professional Designs Made Easy — Without the Monthly Fees” and “Zero Subscriptions Forever.” That is a real decision, not a vibe.\n\nI am not going to tell you Plasfy is better. I have not run a client project through it. I opened plasfy.com and canva.com/pricing on 23 August 2026 and wrote down what those pages actually publish. Where a number is missing, or the same page disagrees with itself, I will say so.",

The live homepage advertises 20,000+ templates, 100+ formats, canvas resize, 10 million images, 2,500 fonts and 30 million graphics, plus an AI graphics creator, an AI background remover and transparent PNG export.\n\nThe commercial offer on that same page, today, is not a free plan. It is a “Lifetime Founders” deal at $199. The card lists: all features unlocked, Plasfy AI Graphics Factory, those 20,000+ templates, 100+ formats, unlimited AI background remover, millions of royalty-free stock images, transparent PNG exports, unlimited projects, 200GB image cloud storage, a commercial licence, tutorials, and “all future updates included.” It also advertises a 30-day money-back guarantee and a one-time payment.\n\nTwo FAQ answers matter more than the feature list. Plasfy says it is cloud software that works in a web browser. And it says, in plain language: “We don’t support iPads or Tablets.” If your design work lives on a tablet, that sentence ends the comparison before price does.\n\nThe checkout URL on the page is app.plasfy.com/order/professional/. There is also a path branded plasfy-free. That is a sales funnel name. It is not a $0 product.",

Official extras include premium tools they name as resize, translate and remove background; 3.6 million+ templates including premium; 141 million+ premium photos, videos, graphics and audio; five Brand Kits; social content scheduling; 100GB of storage; and ten times the Free AI allowance.\n\nBusiness is US$250 per year per person. Enterprise is “let’s talk.” Canva also states that K-12 education organisations and not-for-profits can get most premium features for free, and that prices exclude tax.\n\nThose are US-dollar figures on canva.com/pricing.

                "body": "If the question is “is Plasfy a free Canva alternative?”, the honest answer on 23 August 2026 is no.\n\nCanva has a documented $0 plan with a large free library. Plasfy’s live homepage is selling a $199 lifetime seat. Older Plasfy sales pages — still on the same domain — have advertised other one-time prices, including $19 and $29, and have also talked about a future $144-per-year subscription. I am not treating those archived funnels as today’s price. I am treating the $199 on the current homepage as today’s price, and I am noting that Plasfy’s own marketing has moved that number before.\n\n“Lifetime” is a sales word. It means Plasfy is promising this purchase covers future updates. It does not mean the company, the editor, or the stock library is immortal. If that promise is why you would pay, read their current terms before you pay — I am not going to paraphrase a legal page I have not quoted.",

If your job is “open a social template and change the text,” Canva’s free shelf is the larger shelf, on their own numbers.\n\nPlasfy’s bet is different: pay once, stop hitting Pro crowns, keep commercial-licence assets without a monthly bill. Whether $199 is cheaper than Canva Pro depends on how long you would have paid Canva. US$180 a year is the Pro figure on Canva’s yearly page today. Two years of Pro is already more than $199. That arithmetic only helps if you would have paid Pro, and if Plasfy still does the work you need.\n\nI have not counted either library myself. I am repeating the numbers each company prints.",

I am not going to pretend I read a balanced official comparison that the public cannot open.\n\nThat is useful information on its own. If a company that sells against Canva locks its own comparison, you should not treat third-party “Plasfy vs Canva” charts as gospel either. Several of those charts still list monthly Plasfy plans around $9. That is not what plasfy.com is selling today.",

Paying $199 to escape a bill I am not paying is a bad trade.\n\nIf I was already paying Canva Pro every year for resize, background removal and premium stock, and I do my work in a desktop browser, Plasfy is worth opening before the next renewal. The $199 figure is the one on their homepage today. I would confirm the tablet limitation first. I would not buy it from a “closes this page and the price goes up” banner without reading the refund terms.\n\nIf I needed brand kits, team approvals, a social planner, or an Education plan, Plasfy’s homepage does not document those as Canva documents them. I would not migrate a team on a feature list I cannot see.",

I did not test export quality, the AI background remover, or the commercial licence against a real client job. I did not time a design in both editors.\n\nI also did not copy Plasfy’s testimonial block. Testimonials on a sales page are not a source.\n\nIf you need a simpler free editor with no account at all, that is a different product.

I am comfortable writing that. I am not comfortable writing “three saves a day” or “five saves a day,” because that number is not on the official pricing page I checked. Third-party reviews disagree with each other. When a company will not print the cap, I will not invent it.\n\nIf you need to know the exact free save limit, open Pixlr, make a file, and watch what the save button does.

Exports — they list PNG, JPG, PDF, GIF and MP4 — render on your device and save locally. Designs stay in the browser session unless you choose to save to an online workspace. Accounts are optional, and only for cloud save across sessions.\n\nThey also document the small leaks that “nothing leaves your machine” marketing usually skips. The editor may load fonts from Google Fonts. It may use lightweight analytics depending on your browser and ad-blocker. They say those requests do not send your design data.\n\nThat is still a free editor. I did not hit a paywall opening the studio. I am not going to claim I designed a 40-page brand book in it.",

On Reddit, the same project account has described the app as working like a browser / webview, and has said offline music is not offered because the app is based on YouTube.\n\nI am treating those as the makers’ own description of the pipe. I am not treating lyramusic.app’s quieter homepage as a contradiction that erases them.\n\nIf the audio is YouTube, Lyra is a YouTube listening client with a music-first interface and a playlist importer.

Family is ₦2,500 a month for up to six people at the same address, with parental controls for the plan manager.\n\nOfficial Premium extras they list against Free: ad-free listening, offline downloads, play songs in any order, higher audio quality, listen with friends in real time, organise the queue.\n\nThose naira figures are from spotify.com/ng/premium.

Lyra’s site presents listening as free. The team has also said there is an optional upgrade for higher audio quality. I did not find a public price for that upgrade on the homepage I checked, so I am not inventing one.\n\nOffline: Spotify documents downloads on Premium. Lyra’s makers have said offline is not offered on the YouTube pipe.\n\nAccount: Spotify needs one. Lyra says you can start without one; an account is for sync.\n\nCars and speakers: both claim car support. Spotify also documents a long hardware list — watches, TVs, consoles, smart speakers. Lyra claims CarPlay, Android Auto, AirPlay and Google Cast. I have not tested either claim in a car for this piece.\n\nPodcasts: both advertise them. I did not audit either library.",

People try Lyra because ₦1,600 is a bill, Spotify Free has ads, and a clean player that imports playlists feels like relief.\n\nRelief is not the same as a replacement. If YouTube takes the stream down, Lyra cannot play it. If Google or Apple decide a YouTube-wrapper music app is a problem — they have decided that about other apps — the store listing is not a constitutional right. I am not forecasting a takedown.
